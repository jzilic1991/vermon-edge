Version 1.1.11
--------------
- Made FALSE monitorable in every context.
- Bug fix (reported by Martin Raszyk): Formulas of the form "alpha AND
  (EXISTS x. beta)" are rewritten to "alpha AND (EXISTS x. (alpha AND
  beta))" under some circumstances. The rewriting did not avoid the
  capture of alpha's free variables by the quantifier. If this rewrite
  rule is applied, the bound variables are now substituted by fresh
  variables first.
- Bug fix (reported by Dawit Legesse Tirore): Formulas of the forms
      alpha AND (beta SINCE[a,b) gamma)
      alpha AND (beta UNTIL[a,b) gamma)
  with finite b were incorrectly rewritten to
      alpha AND ((EVENTUALLY[a,b) alpha) AND beta SINCE[a,b) gamma)
      alpha AND ((ONCE[a,b) alpha) AND beta UNTIL[a,b) gamma)
  To yield equivalent formulas, the interval of the inserted operator
  is extended to [0,b).
- Bug fix: Formulas of the form "c <- AGG x ONCE alpha" for any
  aggregation operator AGG except MIN/MAX used to distinguish between
  alpha's satisfactions at different time-points. This was a deviation
  from the semantics published in FMSD 46(3):262–285 (2015).
- Bug fix: Nesting future operators under PREVIOUS could trigger
  assertion failures and/or runtime exceptions. The tracking of not yet
  evaluated time-stamps has been completely reworked to address this.
- Bug fix (reported by Matthieu Gras): Nesting future operators under NEXT could
  trigger assertion failures.
- Bug fix (reported by Matthieu Gras): UNTIL operators were sometimes
  evaluated incorrectly.
- Internal: Use Dune as the build system.

Version 1.1.10
--------------
- Formulas with empty or negative intervals are no longer accepted.
- Formulas are now type-checked.
- The default values for empty aggregations without grouping have
  changed. They now depend on the type of the aggregated variable:

    Input:    int           float           string
    Agg.:
      avg     float / 0.    float / 0.      (not supported)
      sum     int   / 0     float / 0.      (not supported)
      cnt     int   / 0     int   / 0       int    / 0
      min     int   / 0     float / inf     string / ""
      max     int   / 0     float / -inf    string / ""
      med     float / 0.    float / 0       (not supported)

    Each cell in the table shows the type of the result value / the
    default value.

- Bug fixes:

  * Fixed a bug related to a corner case in the evaluation of "NOT alpha
    UNTIL beta". (This was reported by Martin Raszyk.)

  * Fixed the evaluation of subformulas of the form "NOT alpha UNTIL
    beta" which assumed that "NOT alpha" should also hold at the
    evaluation point when "beta" holds at the evaluation point.

  * For subformulas of the form "alpha OR beta", the attributes of the
    relation computed for beta had the wrong order.

  * Fixed a bug in the evaluation of "MIN/MAX ... ONCE" aggregations.

  * In median aggregations over integers, the result was not always
    a float, depending on the number of aggregated values.

  * It is now possible to count strings, which used to trigger an
    exception.

Version 1.1.9
-------------
- Bug fixes (reported by Martin Raszyk, Joshua Schneider, and Dmitriy Traytel):

  * "NOT PREVIOUS phi" and "NOT NEXT phi" were wrongly rewritten to
    "PREVIOUS NOT phi" and "NEXT NOT phi". Such subformulas are not
    rewritten anymore.

  * The attributes of the relations computed for subformulas phi =
    "alpha SINCE_I beta" have the wrong order if the left-to-right
    order of variables in phi differs from that in beta. Same for
    "alpha UNTIL_I beta". The attributes for such phi subformulas are
    now those of beta followed by those of alpha.

  * In some cases, MonPoly was outputting satisfactions also for the
    virtually added maximal time-stamp. For this virtual timestamp no
    output is now produced.

Version 1.1.8
-------------
- Bug fixes (reported by Étienne André):

  There were indeed some inconsistencies the typing of the fields of
  the tp, ts, and tpts predicates. Now they should be consistent: the
  tp field should be an integer, while the ts field should be a
  rational (for both ts and tpts predicates).

Version 1.1.7
-------------
- Simplified and extented output for non-monitorable formulas.
- Small bug fixes.

Version 1.1.6
-------------
- Small bug fixes.

Version 1.1.5
-------------
- Small bug fixes.

Version 1.1.4
-------------
- Syntax change: Variables do not need to be prefix by the ? symbol.
  (For the syntax of aggregations, see the formulas in the
  experiments/policies directory.)
- Note: In comparison to the FMSD submission, the trigger operator is
  not supported, and the past always operator is treated as sytactic
  sugar for NEG ONCE NEG.
- Support for the MED ("median") aggregation operator.
- Support for floating point numbers.
- AVG return a floting point number, not an integer.
- New function symbols: MOD, and the type convertors f2i and i2f.

Version 1.1.3
-------------
- extension to aggregation operators and function symbols; limitations:
  - aggregation only on variables and not on arbitrary terms
  - only arithmetic functions
  - average returns an integer, not a float
  - rudimentary type checking
  - some rules (e.g. RIG_{\land\neg}) are not implemented yet

Version 1.1.2
-------------
- Performance improvement in the evaluation of subformulas of the form
phi AND psi, where the free variables of phi form a subset of the
free variables of psi.

- An accompanying translation from MFOTL formulas to SQL queries.

Version 1.1.1
-------------
- Small bug fixes.

Version 1.1.0
-------------
- Implemented two log filters which filter tuples and empty time
  points based on the input formula

- Implemented a new algorithm to incrementally compute the satisfying
  tuples for temporal subformulas (see the Sliding module)

- Relation.minus is now computed as an anti-join instead of a
  equi-join followed by a set difference.

- Improvement in computing the satisfying tuples for some temporal
  subformulas, by merging time-points with equal time-stamps.

- Signature files should now contain both variable names and
  corresponding types.

- Saving and loading the monitor state currently disabled.

- Minor bug fixes.


Version 1.0.1
-------------
- Minor bug fix.

- Added an example (the more complex policy from the RV'11 tool
  paper).

- Empty relations accepted in the log files.


Version 1.0.0
-------------
First release.
